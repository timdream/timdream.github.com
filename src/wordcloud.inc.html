<p><a href="https://timdream.org/wordcloud/" target="_blank"><strong>HTML5 Word Cloud</strong></a> was a web technology demonstration that process <strong class="soft">text corpus</strong> into words, and leverages <strong>Canvas2DContext API</strong> to layout words into a <strong class="soft">“word cloud.”</strong></p>

<p>It started back when I was working on <a href="/portfolio/moztw/">Firefox localization</a>.
I was trying to access the quality of the UI <strong class="soft">text corpus</strong> with some simple natural language processing tricks. </p>

<p>It accidentally gains popularity and grew into a full-fledged <strong class="soft">client-side web application</strong> when I added features allowing users to pull texts from their social networks.
I did that by incorporating <strong>OAuth 2</strong> integration with <strong>Google+</strong>, <strong>Facebook API</strong> integration, and Google Feed API.</p>

<p>To promote reusability, the web application has since split into different libraries, <a href="https://timdream.org/wordcloud2.js/" target="_blank">wordcloud2.js</a>, and <a href="https://timdream.org/wordfreq/" target="_blank">wordfreq.js</a>, each represents the canvas rendering and the text corpus generation features.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I had to gut these features out when various APIs shuts down which prevented me from accessing their user data.</p>

<p>I made sure the code is reusable for other developers by complete the repository with documentation, <strong>Travis CI</strong>, and test cases.
It still receives occasional contributions on <strong class="soft">GitHub</strong> to this day.
