<p>I’ve been making websites since <strong>Geocities</strong> days, and have been bonding with friends online since.
When I left high school, I signed up <strong class="soft">physics</strong> as a major because I figured there should be more wonder in the physical world than in the computer science.
With that, I made my way to the <strong>Department of Physics</strong> at <strong>National Central University</strong>.</p>

<p>Even as a physics-major, I wanted to marry my interest in building things on the Web and physics.
<strong class="soft">Dr. Ching-Chi Chu</strong> gave me the fantastic opportunity to create a website for her laboratory, the <strong>Physics Demonstration Laboratory</strong>, which pioneered demonstrating physics concepts through specially crafted equipments and demonstrations.</p>

<p>At the time, I tried to piece many features into the website — based on <strong>WordPress</strong>, it came with an <strong>oEmbed</strong>-powered video uploading and transcoding service, mathematical equation rendering based on <strong>LaTeX</strong>, and few other <strong>custom plug-ins</strong>. I managed the Linux hosting myself and picked up some <strong class="soft">Linux server administration skill</strong> along the way..

<p>I was happy with the recognition for connecting my interests and studies.
With this, and <a href="/portfolio/moztw/">my volunteer work at the local Mozilla community</a> lay the foundation for me to bootstrap a career in software engineering.
My career in physics concludes with a <strong class="soft">B. Sc. degree.</strong>

<p class="footnote">The website and the laboratory have since consolidated into <strong>National Central University Science Education Center</strong>.
