<p>At the time, with no official presence in Taiwan, <strong class="soft">Mozilla</strong> was presented by the volunteering interest group, <strong class="soft">the MozTW community</strong>.
Being a Firefox user all the way back in <strong class="soft">2003</strong> with the release of <strong>Firebird 0.8</strong>, I got in touch with the community started getting involved in <strong class="soft">2008</strong>.</p>

<h2>Localization and productization</h2>

<p>The localization effort involves <strong class="soft">translation of UI labels</strong>, coordinating the <strong class="soft">testing effort</strong> of the localized build, and ensure proper <strong class="soft">“productization”</strong> of the product by making decisions about bundling services.
During my tenure as localization manager, I took care of <strong class="soft">Firefox 3.5 and 3.6</strong> and streamlined the localization process by introducing <strong>Narro</strong>, the localization platform at the time.</p>

<h2>Online community campaigns</h2>

<p>MozTW has been actively involved in <strong class="soft">non-traditional community marketing</strong>.
With the website as a portal for Mozilla products for the local population, we came up many <strong class="soft">online promotion events</strong>, like the April Fool event asking people to “<strong>experience features of Internet Explorer 8</strong>” by using <strong class="soft">Firefox</strong> and <strong class="soft">extensions</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Get Firefox</strong> was a promotion website, with the goal of offering every user its customizable page promoting <strong class="soft">Firefox</strong> and their favorite <strong class="soft">extensions</strong>.
Partnering with <strong class="soft">Bob Po-chang Chao</strong> who came up with the product ideas, I developed the website with <strong>PHP</strong> based on <strong class="soft">CodeIgniter</strong> framework, as the sole web developer of the project.
It came with <strong>OpenID</strong> integration, as a way to <strong class="soft">accept third-party identities distributedly</strong> and without the tie to a particular identity system.</p>

<h2>Offline events</h2>

<p>The community has also hosted many of the <strong class="soft">offline promotional events</strong>, including <strong class="soft">launch parties</strong> and <strong class="soft">technical sharing</strong>.
Through these events, I came to be known by the larger professional community.
I was pleased to find out at the end of 2017 a colleague at Mozilla Corporation came to know Mozilla because of the campus event we had held.
It was another <strong class="soft">connecting-the-dot moment</strong>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I passed the torch of localization manager when I left school, given the requirement of me entering <strong class="soft">compulsory civil service</strong>, an alternative to military conscription.
After the service, my work on OpenID integration and UI research landed me <a href="/portfolio/academia-sinica/">a position at Academia Sinica</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never officially left the community until my employment in the <strong class="soft">Mozilla Corporation</strong> making actively involvement awkward.
Work and life have prevented me from committing more time into voluntary causes — it was truly an innocent time.

<p class="footnote">The Narro installation was decommissioned. Localization has since been managed centrally at Mozilla Corporation properties.</p>
<p class="footnote">Get Firefox has been shut down on 2017 due to low usage.</p>
<p class="footnote">The community currently operates a physical space, supporting the wider free software and open culture communities.</p>
