<p><strong>Input methods</strong>, or <strong>IME</strong> for short, is a piece of program that is essential for typing <strong>East Asian languages</strong> on computers. I've been struggling how I can introduce the concept, so I ended up <a href="https://timdream.org/jszhuyin/learn/" target="_blank">making a tutorial</a> about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://timdream.org/jszhuyin/" target="_blank"><strong>JSZhuyin</strong></a> implements <strong class="soft">a production quality input method</strong> for mobile devices entirely in JavaScript. It was one of the first features I made, as a prototype, in <a href="/portfolio/firefox-os/" target="_blank">Firefox OS</a>. I later decided to pull it out and put it on the Web, since it became apparent that it's unlikely to ship on any model.</p>

<p>Given the complexity of what an IME needs to do, the project has since been <strong class="soft">the perfect playground</strong> for me to try out various JavaScript and <strong class="soft">browser technologies</strong>, including <strong>IndexedDB</strong>, <strong>Typed Array</strong>, and <strong>Service Workers</strong>.
A binary array was implemented for data-keeping, to guarantee performance on <strong class="soft">low-memory environments</strong>.
Various test suites were built to ensure its correctness and performance, given the intricacy involved.
