<p>The legacy code base of <strong>Firefox</strong> represents a sizable challenge to newcomers like my team and me in Taipei, even though I am excited to eventually work on a browser that I’ve used every day for the past ten years.</p>

<p>I started by picking up <strong class="soft">the proprietary XUL architecture</strong> and its layout quirks, trying my best to make it work. I’ve managed to keep my capability as <strong class="soft">a hands-on engineer</strong> and take on my duty as <strong class="soft">a manager</strong>, <strong class="soft">at the same time</strong>. The Taipei team started by taking part of removing small glitches on the UI, and gradually moving to bigger features like <strong class="soft">date/time input</strong> and <strong class="soft">form autofill enhancements</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve also given the role of growing a new <strong class="soft">Firefox for Android</strong> team in Taipei, managing five additional Android engineers.</p>

<p>In early 2017, the entire engineering of the company was moved to an umbrella project named <strong>“Quantum,”</strong> aiming to give the flagship product <strong class="soft">a performance boost and a slick and modern look</strong>. I supervised the team to deliver the refreshed Preferences page and the introductory tour that would introduce the <strong class="soft">“New Firefox”</strong> to new users. </p>

<p>One of the focal points for the new Firefox was to ensure its <strong class="soft">60 fps UI performance</strong>.  I’ve paid particular attention to investigate the approaches, and removed a timeout to make the UI more responsive.</p>

<p>With my leadership on Quantum front-end features and contributions to Firefox, I was recognized as a Firefox <strong class="soft">“module peer”</strong> in the Mozilla open source project hierarchy.</p>

<p>2018 marked the beginning of my transition back to an individual contributor. During the year, my peers and I completed the work <strong class="soft">removing the legacy XUL widgets</strong> (“XBL,” short for “XUL Binding Language”) from the web rendering implementation, unlocked many of the platform optimizations. We have also charted a viable path to migrate the Firefox UI front-end away from XBL; <strong class="soft">the standardized web components features</strong> will replace many of them.<a aria-label="Next chapter" class="end-mark" href="/portfolio/apple/"></a></p>
