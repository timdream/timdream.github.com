<p><strong class="soft">Owl Publishing</strong> was an established publishing house, itself being under the bigger <strong class="soft">Cité Publishing Group</strong>.
The director of the publisher was keen to make his move finding a way to publish digitally, given the shrinking paper publishing business.</p>

<p><strong class="soft">Digital Publishing</strong> turned out to be a much larger topic than what my position could do.
I worked on <strong class="soft">a PhoneGap-based iOS application</strong> for e-book publishing, and it became apparent with the limited resource and the one man team, I would not be able to take it anywhere.
The publisher had been kept afloat by the revenue from the existing paper publishing business, which was demoralizing to me.</p>

<p>Months into my employment, I was told about the intention of Mozilla Corporation to set up a new office in Taipei, to grow the team for the new Firefox OS project.
Learned about its groundbreaking technical aspect, I put forward my résumé and became the first front-end engineering hire in Taipei, and the ninth employee of the newly established office.
