<p>The principal investigator, <strong class="soft">Dr. Hsiao, Ching-Teng</strong>, had been working on research related to <strong class="soft">social networking</strong> for quite some time. My limited time with the team had been working on maintaining <strong class="soft">the OpenID provider service</strong>. Iâ€™ve also co-authored <strong class="soft">a technical manual on OpenID integration</strong>.</p>

<p>I soon realized the academic atmosphere was not the environment where I could strive. The opportunity came when Owl Publishing offered me a position to work on some prototypes of a digital publishing vehicle.
