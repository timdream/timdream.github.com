<p>My involvement in the <strong class="soft">Firefox OS</strong> project lasts <strong class="soft">a little more than four years</strong>, out of its five-year existence.
I started as a junior engineer and moved up to became <strong class="soft">an engineering manager</strong>, leading <strong class="soft">a front-end team</strong>.</p>

<p>As <strong class="soft">a front-end engineer</strong>, I was super excited to join the project and the company.
I wholeheartedly believed Firefox OS could allow Mozilla to have a say in <strong class="soft">the Mobile Web</strong>, thus continue to project its influence over <strong class="soft">the Web Platform</strong>.</p>

<p>I got started immediately with the front-end code base and lay out the foundations.
I worked as hard as I could, improving what I could think of everywhere, tried to stay connected with the rest of the team even with <strong class="soft">the time zone difference</strong>.
In the end, I unintentionally kept the title of <strong class="soft">top committers of the repository</strong>.

<p>I’ve also hired the Taipei front-end team from scratch.
Eventually, the front-end team in Taipei represented one-third of the front-end engineering.
Many of the hires were great engineers, together we overhauled <strong class="soft">the Settings app</strong>, <strong class="soft">the Keyboard app</strong> and keeping <strong class="soft">its 60 fps performance</strong>.
I was particularly proud when the bootstrap sequence of the phone, in the <strong class="soft">“System app”</strong>, was eventually retrofitted into a <strong class="soft">Promise</strong> chain.</p>

<p>The phone finally shipped in <strong class="soft">Central- and South-America countries</strong>, <strong class="soft">Europe</strong>, <strong class="soft">India</strong>, and <strong class="soft">Japan</strong>, although Firefox OS never got the traction the company had hoped.
Eager for commercial success, the project moved from one partner from another and tried to jam every hardware-centric features the partner had asked.
Regretfully, we never had time to pause and re-orientate on overall user experience.</p>

<p>Eventually, Firefox OS was discontinued.
The engineering group in Taipei then became its cost center, and I took the team to work on desktop Firefox features.

<p class="footnote">Many of my team members, with a few colleagues, have been continuing working on a commercial fork of Firefox OS known as “<a href="https://www.kaiostech.com">KaiOS</a>”. It is currently the second-largest mobile OS in India.</p>
